# Staff Control v2.0 Migration – Implementation Summary

## Snapshot
- **Progress to date:** Phases 1.1 – 6.3 are complete, covering security baselines, file storage abstraction, TimescaleDB dual-write, the Agent Gateway, policy distribution, and first-party device adapters.
- **In flight:** Adapter lifecycle automation (6.4), adapter-focused QA (6.5), and all observability/auto-update/communications phases (7 – 12) remain open.
- **Key code areas:** `libs/shared/{security,storage,timescale,database}`, `apps/agent-gateway`, `apps/device-adapter-platform`, `apps/agent-api`.
- **Verification status:** Unit and integration specs exist for new modules, but several suites depend on forthcoming lifecycle hooks before they can run end‑to‑end.

## Delivered Capabilities

### Security & Platform Foundation
- API key lifecycle, mTLS certificate automation, and Prisma RLS session management shipped in `libs/shared/security` and `libs/shared/database`.
- Baseline metrics and security regression suites enforce performance guardrails and access controls.

### File Storage Abstraction
- Pluggable storage services (local, S3, MinIO) with encryption, retention, and migration tooling live under `libs/shared/storage`.
- Migration progress tracking, checksum validation, and rollback orchestration support mixed backends.

### TimescaleDB Integration
- Dual-datasource Prisma client, hypertable migrations, and circuit-breaking fallback logic implemented in `libs/shared/database` and `libs/shared/timescale`.
- Load-testing harnesses simulate 1000 msg/s ingestion and verify replay sync during failover.

### Agent Gateway Platform
- Modular NestJS microservice (`apps/agent-gateway`) with buffer management, batch uplink, mutual‑TLS HTTPS client, WebSocket control channel, and performance/health monitoring services.
- Integration specs cover buffer overflow handling, retry semantics, and long-lived WebSocket sessions.

### Policy Distribution & Command Queue
- Versioned policy store, PostgreSQL-backed command queue, delivery retries, and restart/hot-reload orchestration implemented across `apps/dashboard-api` and `apps/agent-gateway`.
- Monitoring hooks capture distribution latency, retry depth, and acknowledgement outcomes.

### Device Adapter Implementations
- Adapter registry/configuration services (`apps/device-adapter-platform`) support dynamic loading, validation, and health checks.
- Hikvision ISAPI adapter and ZKTeco SDK adapter deliver device control, event forwarding, and biometric/user sync paths.
- Lifecycle isolation, hot reload, and mock-device test harnesses are outlined but not yet automated (tasks 6.4 – 6.5).

## Known Gaps & Risks
- Adapter lifecycle management, failure isolation dashboards, and disable/enable workflows are pending, leaving partial manual steps for production rotation.
- Observability stack (Prometheus/Loki/Tempo/Grafana), gateway auto-update, and communications rollout are untouched; production readiness depends on these follow-on phases.
- Several integration suites reference lifecycle hooks that are still stubs, so CI cannot yet exercise full multi-service flows.

## Validation & Tooling
- Jest unit specs accompany storage, security, and gateway modules; Timescale and storage services expose dedicated benchmarking utilities.
- Gateway integration suites (`apps/agent-gateway/src/app/integration-tests`) simulate sustained load, buffering pressure, and control-channel churn.
- Manual validation checklists exist for certificate rotation and key provisioning but still require scripted execution.

## Upcoming Focus
1. Finish adapter lifecycle automation (task 6.4) so registry reloads, health gating, and failure containment are production ready.
2. Build adapter QA harnesses (task 6.5), including mock Hikvision/ZKTeco endpoints and regression specs.
3. Stand up the observability stack (tasks 7.x) to ground the performance baselines collected during phases 1–4.
